                    3d artist and game designer.

                    Although the department I studied was focused on software and business administration but i developed myself in the designing.

                    The name of my project is Easy Home Layout, users will be able to create a 3d view of their house by logging into the program with the dimensions and locations of their rooms,
                    and they will see how the layout of their rooms will look with the pre-prepared 3d model library and whether the layout can be achieved when the room layout is changed.
